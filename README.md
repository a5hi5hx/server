# AdoptMe Server

Developed the Adoptme mobile app using Flutter, enabling users to find and adopt pets, with features like user profiles, favorites, and notifications, integrated via a backend API for pet information and user authentication. Additionally, created a Node.js server with a RESTful API for CRUD operations, enhancing efficiency with Express.js and Mongoose, and deployed it on Cyclic and MongoDB Atlas.
